# Neirlink Website Project
Work in progress — by @shiramatsura.
**All rights reserved.**

This project is a platform designed to share and showcase **artworks, games, fictions, videos**, and more — a mix between **NewGrounds.com** and **itch.io**. The goal is to provide creators with a space to easily upload and display their creations.

Currently, the platform is still in development, but the core functionality is under construction.  
The domain name is **neirlink.com**. My Apache configuration encrypts HTTP for better safety, but as no official SSL certificate has been obtained yet (since the website is hosted locally), this encryption is mostly symbolic for now.

### Note:
> This project fills the gap in my GitHub while I continue to learn and develop more features. It is a work in progress and will evolve over time.  
> I will add configuration instructions once the account creation feature is implemented.  
> Right now, due to lack of proper domain configuration and database setup, the website may not work as expected.

### Current Features:
- **Navbar (in progress)**: The "Explore" link currently redirects to nowhere. I'll probably add a style to make it stick to the top of the page and show on hover.
- **Sign In**: It is currently possible to log in as the user "lobelios389" (a placeholder user) using the associated password stored in *website/sql/base.sql*.  
    > Password is hashed using **SHA256**, though this method will change in the future.


### Next Steps (possibly in no particular order):
- Implement account creation (currently being worked on) and update password hashing method.
- Develop upload and display functionalities for various media (artworks, games, etc.).
- Implement a **page creation** feature so users can create and manage their own pages.
- Develop an **Explore** page and a **search tool** to help users find specific content.
- Develop an algorithm to analyze user preferences and recommend content they may like.
- Implement **responsive design** for a better user experience on all devices.

### Tech stack:
- **PHP**: Backend server-side logic and handling requests.
- **HTML**: Frontend structure for the website pages, generated by PHP.
- **CSS**: Styles to improve the layout and presentation of the website.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend interactivity and dynamic content, using the `fetch` API to handle server-side requests.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user and content data.

### File Structure (WIP):
The file structure is still a work in progress. I plan to separate user-created pages from the main website and assign them their own subdomains.  
Likewise, files uploaded by users will be handled as private resources, ensuring that users cannot access each other's files.
